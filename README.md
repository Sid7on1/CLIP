# CLIP
CLIP From Scratch is a clean PyTorch implementation of OpenAIâ€™s CLIP model. It uses ResNet-50 as a vision encoder and BERT-base for text encoding to align image and text pairs using contrastive loss. Includes training, inference, and modular design for easy integration and experimentation.
